Specify that other documents may create service-specific instantiations with their own RRtypes.  Protocols/services without special needs and willing to use SRV-style attribute leaf labels could also just use \"B\" directly. \r\n\r\n* In a separate draft define the \"HTTPS\" RRtype as an instantiation of \"B\" and define the HTTPS-specific semantics and behaviors, such as the mapping to AltSvc.  (A similar separate draft could also define \"NS2\".)  Separate RRTypes are really only needed when differentiation between services is needed on a name without attribute leaf labels.\r\n* How to handle the SvcFieldValue key=value pairs is one of the biggest open questions for me:\r\n    * The simple model would be to leave this as plain text and leave it up to application/service protocol bindings to define meanings.  HTTPS could then continue to use the Alt-Svc format.\r\n    * A much more ambitious approach would be to define the key=value pairs in a much structured way (perhaps but with a mapping for HTTPS over to Alt-Svc format in that separate draft).  This could allow for a few types of values (and I'm not sure what the right set of these is):  strings;  binary blobs (eg, for keys);  inlined RRDATA; references over to other {RRNames/RRTypes}.  This could become especially powerful if done right by allowing something like an ESNI key to either be literally included in the SvcFieldValue, or to be the name of another record (with a different TTL) containing the ESNI key, for example.  This could also support inlining AAAA/A records into a SvcFieldValue value element, perhaps.  This pushes even more complexity into clients, perhaps.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Type codes are controlled by a new IANA registry.  Data format is type-dependent.\r\n\r\nHTTPSSVC (and NS2, etc.) would share the global IANA type code registry, adding type codes for port, ALPN, and ESNIKeys (which are all we need right now).  Some type codes (like port, ESNIKeys) are likely to be useful in multiple RRTYPEs, while others (like ALPN) are likely to be exclusive to a single RRTYPE.\r\n\r\nHTTPSSVC's zone-file representation remains unchanged.  SRV2/B also has a host file representation that doesn't require parsing the TLV data, and HTTPSSVC can be represented in this form if the implementation doesn't recognize one of the keys.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?",

If the CDN were willing to add a label to the vanity alias, it could use a CNAME instead.  Alternatively, the CDN could place the ServiceForm record there, although that might be inconvenient if \"cdn.example\" is a simple static domain, because the ServiceForm record is highly \"dynamic\" (frequently updated and geo-targeted).\r\n\r\nGiven that CDN apex vanity aliases are currently impossible, I don't think this is a motivating use case, but I would still like to ask the working group before ruling it out.\r\n\r\nEDIT: A more compelling use case might be for zone structure flexibility.  If AliasForm can appear more than once, that makes it easier for CNAME users to add zone cuts that would put the CNAME at an apex, since they can replace the CNAME with an AliasForm without worrying that there might already be an AliasForm earlier in the chain.",

There's already been some confusion in the security models in https://github.com/httpwg/http-extensions/pull/866.\r\n\r\n(Really this reflects flaws in Alt-Svc than anything else.

That is, you trust the record itself, and the certificate check on connection is only to verify that the alternative connection hasn't been subverted.\r\n\r\nWith HTTPSSVC, unless you have DNSsec, there are one or more intermediaries who might have changed that record en route, meaning you can't fully trust it.  The certificate check on the declared alternative therefore serves to confirm the authenticity of the record itself, not just the connection to the alternative.\r\n\r\nThis is also true for Alt-Svc delivered over HTTP -- it could have been tampered with in transit, and therefore only the certificate confirms that the Alt-Svc field was legitimate.  An intermediary who could tamper with the Alt-Svc field could also have tampered with the content, but Alt-Svc permits them to persistent that control.

Maybe one of the parameters not directly involved in verification was bad. Or maybe it was all invalid, but the network directed the invalid alternative name to the real server, in an attempt to get you to believe the rest of the HTTPSSVC record.

It's negotiated in the TLS handshake, which gives us nice properties:\r\n* Deployment concerns are minimal. A single server can unilaterally reconfigure itself without consequences, so gradual rollout, rollback, etc., is natural.\r\n* Downgrade protection is natural. TLS promises that the protocol you get is the one you should have gotten.\r\n\r\nThis makes this a nice pattern for HTTP/2. We get the above for free. QUIC runs over UDP and can't use this trick. It needs an out-of-band signal, perhaps in an HTTP header (`Alt-Svc`, formerly `Alternate-Protocol`) or the DNS (this draft). Both of these involve some client state (caching, etc.). This has analogous consequences:\r\n* The server's configuration may get out of sync with the client's state. A priori, this means connection failure, so we must handle this. We pair QUIC with a TCP fallback (or run in parallel), which we need anyway due to network intolerance. Corollary: the TCP fallback is critical.\r\n* We do not have natural downgrade protection. An attacker can cause us to negotiate the \"wrong\" one of the two. Indeed we *want* this for network intolerance. Corollary: the QUIC and TCP flows must be capable of comparable security.\r\n\r\nI may be overgeneralizing from these examples, but these two properties seem closely related. Downgrade protection means you selected the thing you were supposed to, but if your selection is based on possibly stale information, it's hard to have downgrade protection. (Unless maybe the server reacts to your stale information and has an in-band fixup operation, in which case the out-of-band signal is more a hint than a selection mechanism.)\r\n\r\nAnyway, I think this framing helps illustrate how different of animals TLS/ALPN and HTTPSSVC/ALPN are.",

In the scheme of PR #89, endpoints without HTTP/1.1 support are clearly marked, so clients that need HTTP/1.1 can identify the relevant endpoints before the connection attempt.  If instead of (h2, h3) the protocol set was (tls, quic), clients would have to attempt the connection before learning that \"http/1.1\" is not supported.\r\n\r\nTo generalize, whenever a client might be compatible with only a subset of endpoints, the client must either be able to tell this from the DNS record or must implement fallback.  The list of ALPNs isn't necessary for enabling the client to attempt a connection to an endpoint, but it is useful to allow clients to avoid attempts that will fail.",

The key thing about hints is that they are non-binding. They do not impact how an individual connection is negotiated, which is important for both the downgrade protection and deployability aspects above.\r\n\r\nIn contrast, the TCP+TLS vs QUIC indication is not a hint. It fundamentally impacts how an individual connection is negotiated. It does not have the downgrade protection and deployability properties.

Due to deployment requirements, instances may have different configurations temporarily, but we assume it eventually converges over time.\r\n\r\nThus these kinds of uneven deployment games are only acceptable in scenarios where we don't care about downgrade protection (TCP vs QUIC) because we met the same needs in other ways (QUIC must be able to meet TCP's security level).",

(See #88.)\r\n\r\nIt's also generally more compact to handle multiplicity within the value. Each HTTPSSVC value costs four bytes of framing per value. If the value is self-delimiting (true for addresses and ESNIConfig), you have a one-time four byte cost from HTTPSSVC, then each additional value costs no extra framing. If the value is not self-delimiting, you need length prefixes internally, costing two bytes per value. That's two bytes extra at one value, breaking even at two values, and a win beyond that.\r\n\r\n(The difference comes from not repeating the parameter name each time.)",

That internal format may be a single structure, a list of structures, or something more complicated.\r\n* Duplicate parameters are a syntax error. The receiver treats this as a parse error.\r\n* Keys must be listed in ascending order, so the receiver can check for duplicates without maintaining much state. Non-sorted keys are a parse error.\r\n\r\nRe protocol IDs not having fixed lengths, just add length prefixes as needed. That's all a multi-valued parameter is doing anyway.

See also all the problems when things get stuck into C-style strings.)\r\n\r\n(I still need to review #97, but I doubt a `vector<transport>` would work anyway given that you need a port number. If it ends up being a `vector<tuple<transport, port>>` or a different design, that further suggests a key-specific serialization. A `vector<tuple<transport, port>>` needs a length prefix on the transport, not on the overall tuple.)",

      "body": "The draft originally said (prior to #66) said the Alt-Svc cache overrides HTTPSSVC. This had problems (issue #58 and #60), so #66 downgraded it to a MAY. It seems this still has problems.\r\n\r\n**HTTPSSVC vs Alt-Svc**\r\n\r\nConsider a server which uses both QUIC and ESNI. It configures both in HTTPSSVC. It also cares about HTTPSSVC-less clients (older client or legacy DNS resolver), so it configures QUIC in Alt-Svc. Is it required to configure ESNI in Alt-Svc, or can it leave things alone (with the understanding that ESNI will be limited to clients that support HTTPSSVC)?\r\n\r\nThe spec currently says a client (that would otherwise support HTTPSSVC) MAY skip an HTTPSSVC lookup given an Alt-Svc cache entry. That means, for ESNI to work, the server MUST configure it in both. This is not obvious and should be written down. More importantly, it has deployment consequences.\r\n\r\nHTTPSSVC records apply to the *current* HTTP request. If the client has no cached DNS record, it still queries DNS and gets HTTPSSVC. That means HTTPSSVC TTLs may be set more-or-less freely depending on the site's performance vs. flexibility needs. Let's say it's O(1 hour).\r\n\r\nAlt-Svc headers apply to *subsequent* HTTP requests. If the client has no Alt-Svc entry cached, it will send the HTTP request without Alt-Svc. That means Alt-Svc TTLs must cover the time to the next HTTP request for Alt-Svc to be used at all. For reference, I see google.com currently uses 30 days.\r\n\r\n**Commitments**\r\n\r\nFor the duration of the HTTPSSVC or Alt-Svc lifetime, the server operator has made a commitment to the client. ESNI is a soft commitment that the server understands this ESNI key and a hard commitment that the server is colocated with the public name. The first lower-bounds key lifetime and rotation on the server. There is a recovery mechanism, but it is expensive, so this is a soft commitment. The second is roughly a commitment to use a particular hosting provider. ESNI's retry mechanism requires the public name, so this is a hard commitment. Breaking this will knock out your site.\r\n\r\n(Note Alt-Svc without ESNI was *not* a hosting provider commitment. A provider-specific Alt-Svc may fail if the site changes providers, but the client could still connect without Alt-Svc. ESNI must take this fallback away to prevent network downgrade.)\r\n\r\nHTTPSSVC and Alt-Svc commitment timescales are qualitatively different. Saying ESNI servers must advertise in both, as implied by the spec today, means servers must incur a long-lived hosting provider commitment to deploy ESNI at all. (Or send no Alt-Svc headers and lose QUIC on non-HTTPSSVC clients.) It also means ESNI keys must be long-lived, which makes them more sensitive.\r\n\r\n**Proposed fix**\r\n\r\nGiven the above, I don't see how allowing Alt-Svc to override HTTPSSVC is tenable. That suggests changing the spec so a client that makes HTTPSSVC queries makes them even if Alt-Svc is available. If it gets an HTTPSSVC record, it ignores Alt-Svc and uses those instead. Otherwise, it may freely use Alt-Svc.\r\n\r\nThis is fussy because Alt-Svc itself allows replacing the origin hostname with an alternate name. Clients would likely want to query the alternate's A/AAAA records, the origin's A/AAAA records, and the origin/s HTTPSSVC records in parallel. However, the alternate may leak ESNI, so the alternate connection must wait for whether HTTPSSVC aborts it before proceeding past that query.\r\n\r\nThat adds *even more* complexity to the prospect of actually implementing remote Alt-Svc. Personally, I think all these name indirections are seeming more and more like a mistake and questionably worthwhile.\r\n\r\n**Whither ESNI in Alt-Svc?**\r\n\r\nWith the above, it is no longer strictly necessary to allocate a way to spell ESNI in Alt-Svc. I don't know whether we still want to. This issue means ESNI in Alt-Svc is very different from ESNI in HTTPSSVC. At minimum, we must clearly call out the implications of the longer lifetime in the spec. We could decide this is not worth the trouble. On the other hand, it's likely a number of clients won't make HTTPSSVC queries for some time, and perhaps those clients getting ESNI for the subset of servers willing to make a longer-term public name commitment is worthwhile.\r\n\r\n**Parting thought**\r\n\r\nI think a lesson here is we cannot completely abstract ESNI from its delivery mechanism. Pulling ESNI into HTTPSSVC is reasonable so we only have one record to query, but HTTPSSVC's decisions still have implications for ESNI.

While the PR does claim Alt-Svc is unnecessary:\r\n\r\n> Origins MAY use esniconfig in Alt-Svc, HTTPSSVC, both, or neither\r\n\r\nThis is false. Saying it will break sporadically doesn't change the fact that it's broken. It also isn't sporadic: it will deterministicly break for all but the first connection. That does not count as deploying ESNI.\r\n\r\nThe section \"Non-authoritative servers\" needs to go in ESNI with full TLSWG analysis as it has security consequences for both the client and server and affects TLS itself. As to those security consequences, I do not think we should do this. Extracting an authenticated signal out of explicitly getting a bad certificate is *extremely* questionable. Certificate errors may arise from all kinds of reasons. Overloading that would be a problem for a client implementation.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the text mandates particular behavior on unknown names. Given the subtle problems that come up when HTTP servers accept unknown Host headers, I don't think we should introduce such requirements, certainly not via an implicit signal like this.\r\n\r\nThis also still assumes the previous hosting provider behaves in a particular way.\r\n\r\nFinally, this is far too much complexity on the client.

Alt-Svc ESNI is the only near-term path to broad deployment, and broad deployment is important to avoid ossification.\r\n\r\nNote that Alt-Svc ESNI is not HPKP.  The ESNI fallback mechanism allows key rotation, so long as the fallback name doesn't change.  Yes, for good performance you shouldn't set your Alt-Svc lifetime longer than your key rotation period, but occasional clock skews or unscheduled rotations won't break anything.\r\n\r\nAs for lifetimes, ESNI keys are substantially less sensitive than TLS keys, so requiring them to be rotated ultra-frequently seems like a low priority.

          "body": "> I have concerns about any approach where HTTPSSVC without ESNI takes precedence over Alt-Svc ESNI. That arrangement creates an incentive for hostile DNS servers to synthesize fake HTTPSSVC records, in order to override the ESNIConfig received in Alt-Svc.\r\n\r\nIt's certainly true that tying ESNI to DNS has consequences given a hostile DNS server. Both that and the dependency on new DNS records (which effectively depends on DoH) are indeed disappointing. But both properties have been true throughout this iteration of ESNI. We switched to the HTTPSSVC record on the assumption that it was equivalent to the original ESNI record. The Alt-Svc flaw breaks that assumption.\r\n\r\nIf we want to solve the hostile DNS server problem, we would need to get rid of all Alt-Svc failure paths on the client. The hostile DNS server also controls A/AAAA records, so it could blackhole `alt-svc-entrypoint.cdn.example` and cause all Alt-Svc routes to fail. (If we punt that problem and try only to solve the broad deployment problem, an Alt-Svc to HTTPSSVC fallback is tenable, though it alone doesn't solve the name pinning problem.)\r\n\r\nUnless we can make ESNI in Alt-Svc truly equivalent to HTTPSSVC (unlikely given the TTL), it *must* be possible for servers to use HTTPSSVC with ESNI, use Alt-Svc without ESNI, and *still* get ESNI support for clients which support both. That means HTTPSSVC *must* be able to override Alt-Svc.\r\n\r\nIf we can come up with a way to salvage ESNI in Alt-Svc, we can always add some Alt-Svc directive that means this configuration cannot be overridden by HTTPSSVC. (This, of course, would still need to meet all the usual deployability and availability requirements.) We'd also still need to backport all of the ALPN-related fixes or general Alt-Svc support is dead in the water. All of the issues raised in #73 apply to Alt-Svc once ESNI shows up.\r\n\r\n> As for lifetimes, ESNI keys are substantially less sensitive than TLS keys, so requiring them to be rotated ultra-frequently seems like a low priority. Typical TLS certificates last for 90 days. A similar or shorter lifetime for ESNI keys would easily be compatible with Alt-Svc ESNI.\r\n\r\nI agree they're less sensitive. I'm more concerned about the name pinning than the key rotation.\r\n\r\nA footnote on the equivalence to TLS keys however: 90 days is still too long for TLS certificates (the world needs to move to issuance automation). Also, as long-lived keys are fundamentally more sensitive than short-lived keys, server deployments apply extra protections to their long-lived keys like keeping them off of serving frontends. If ESNI keys, due to their lifetime, end up warranting such protections, it would double the cost of such measures.\r\n\r\n> But reasonably short TTLs mostly make sense if clients honor Alt-Svc going to alternate servernames anyways as you want some degree of agility on these.\r\n\r\nCertainly switching the names increases the desire for shorter TTLs, but that doesn't change the nature of Alt-Svc. Alt-Svc fundamentally only applies to *subsequent* connections, so the lifetime must extend to the *next* time you visit the site. (The current visit already has a preexisting connection. Even in clients willing to bear the complexity of cycling to new connection instantly, this is not useful for ossification purposes because blocking the alternate has no availability consequences while the main connection lives.)\r\n\r\nThe requirements on large enough Alt-Svc TTLs get stronger with ESNI. If you only use Alt-Svc as a routing optimization, perhaps you're fine with low Alt-Svc coverage as it's just an optimization. An ESNI-bearing Alt-Svc with small TTL barely applies.\r\n\r\n> (One good use-case would be opportunistically supporting ESNI with QUIC prior to being ready to support it in TLS and before clients support doing HTTPSSVC lookups.)\r\n\r\nThis use case doesn't make sense. Remember that clients will always try TCP. We often say \"fallback\", but this is misleading. One of the failure modes is blackholed packets, so the two are actually run in parallel, so doing this will deterministically leak the SNI.\r\n\r\nIndeed the one of the requirements on any fix to the many Alt-Svc ALPN mistakes is to *prevent* this, so that servers do not accidentally deploy a QUIC-only ESNI. Out-of-band signal => fallback for robustness => failing to provide equivalent security is a server configuration error.",

      "body": "Instead of an \"alpn\" or \"transports\" list, perhaps each transport should be its own SvcParamKey.  Then the transport is considered supported for a record if the parameter appears in the SvcFieldValue parameter list for the record.  Maybe h1/TLS is still considered supported by default unless there's a parameter saying to not use defaults.\r\n\r\nAdvantages:\r\n- Negates the recent debates over a wire format for the transport list.  Transports are now listed in the main SvcFieldValue parameters list using the wire format established for that list.  No need to decide between delimiter separation or length prefixing for a special sub-list.  No need to create a separate string list or value registry for the transport values, as it will just be entries from the SvcParamKey registry.  The parameters will be just as easy to deal with as any other parameters for people dealing with presentation format or text config files.\r\n- Solves recent debates over potential per-transport sub parameters such as port.  Instead of a single \"port\" parameter or encoding port in transport name, transports can allocate bytes to port in the SvcFieldValue value.  This would likely be the only thing in the value for transports defined by the initial RFC, maybe with a value of 0 meaning to use the port from the qname.  Any transports added in the future could define whatever sub parameters make sense for that new transport type (or remove port entirely if non-default ports are disallowed for the new transport).\r\n- Extensibility is consistent with the primary extensibility mechanism for SVCB, that is that adding new transports or changing sub parameters format means adding to the SvcParamKey registry.  New registry additions would have all the extensible flexibility as anything else added that way.",

However, it does also have some disadvantages.\r\n* Each new protocol is allocated from a finite numeric space, so draft protocol versions during development probably can't be expressed in this form.  (We do have a private range reserved in the registry, which might suffice, but conflicts in the private space could also lead to bad outcomes, especially if parsers reject the whole RRSet when there's a conflict.)\r\n* Adding a new transport would require updating all the DNS-related components (authoritative and stub).  With \"transport=...\" new transports are opaque to the DNS-related components, so no updates are required.  (This can be hacked around using the `key1234` mechanism on the authoritative and possibly some escape hatch in SVCB client libraries, but it's ugly as heck.)\r\n* Sharing a namespace with all the other keys could be confusing.\r\n* If we want to add more sub-parameters to a transport later (e.g. QUIC versions), we likely can't, because its SvcParamValue format will already be fixed.\r\n\r\nTo match the current draft's behavior, we would need to define \"quic\", \"tls\", and \"no-tls\" keys.  However, I'm not sure that these keys actually make sense outside the context of a specific scheme (like HTTPS).  For example, can we really use the same \"tls\" key for all the different application-protocols that might be delivered over TLS?\r\n\r\n> maybe with a value of 0 meaning to use the port from the qname\r\n\r\nI would signal that using an empty SvcParamValue, and make \"0\" mean \"disabled\".

Too much chance of conflict with other uncontrolled usage of the private use block.  Seems we wouldn't really be able to use the block at all for experimental new stuff unless we constantly grease with random values from that range and the spec encourages wonky practices like always checking for a checksum in the value to ensure it's actually the param type the client is looking for.  And 2 octets is probably not enough availability overall to let anybody claim large chunks in the registered blocks for multiple experimental code points.\r\n\r\nI suggest we increase to 4 octets, make the unregistered block much larger to reduce the chances of conflicts, and encourage temporary registration of experimental parameters.  Feels to me that 4 octets would be worth it for the main extensibility mechanism of SVCB.  We'd also be able to save a bit of those octets back when params like the EsniConfig could more reasonably create new parameters for new versions instead of spending octets to do versioning within the parameter value as is the current plan.",

The fact that a server supports ECHO is similarly not private.  If you're assuming that the server's set of supported protocols *is* private information, then you need a private way to distribute that information.  ECHO, of course, only permits the transfer of private information from client to server.\r\n\r\nThat said, I don't object to ECHOConfig suggesting innocuous settings for other properties for use on the public side if the TLS WG wants to do that.  (@davidben makes a good point that the public name is less for innocuous value and more for delegating the authority to change config, though.)  I think that's orthogonal to SVCB telling you what the service supports and how to access it.",

The client should put in the ALPN parameters it actually wants to negotiate. The outer ClientHello is to authenticate a key mismatch signal, so negotiated parameters only matter up to authenticating that signal. Thus, ECHO has opinions on the outer name because it selects the authenticating certificate.

It think what we want here is that if the initial parallel query fails use A/AAAA as a lot of DNS devices fail in various forms when queried something not A/AAAA and the ENT or NXDomain handling also is questionable for a lot of DNS servers. \r\n\r\nIf the initial SVCB lookup give you something to follow you should fail on the final resolution, but not on the initial lookup as it will cause to much collateral damage.\r\n\r\nSo long\r\n-Ralf\r\n",

To fix this, we would have to give `alpn` a default value of `http/1.1` (for the HTTPS RR) if the key is absent.\r\n\r\nIn the design you're proposing, `alpn=h2` means that you dropped support for HTTP/1.1-only clients.

That strikes me as more likely to result in swearing sysadmins than the current design, and same for the `alpn=h3` case.\r\n\r\nTo put it another way, I think there are likely to be many orders of magnitude more zone owners configuring these RRs than software developers implementing them, so we should prioritize the ease of (working) configuration over the ease of implementation.",

Both http/1.1 and h2 SVCB records must result in the *exact* same ALPN advertisement, namely all the client's accepted protocols.

Most of those 102 files was saying \"the owner name is not used in this method\".  Part of it was actually passing the name from higher up in the calling stack.

Can you think of a way to avoid the duplication that would be easier for BIND? It's too bad we don't have a name-compression mode that works within an RR.\r\n\r\nWell if you really want it you would need to signal that the client supports intra RR compress for these types.  That is easy enough to do with a EDNS option (option code + list of types the client supports intra RR compression for).  You would need to get a label type assigned for intra RR compression pointers.   IANA already maintains a registry.  The server would need to do case sensitive compression to preserve DNSSEC signatures for when the record was returned to canonical form for DNSSEC processing.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.iana.org/assignments/dns-parameters/dns-parameters.xhtml#dns-parameters-10\r\n\r\n> > I'm also wondering if we should be giving up the ability to signal \"no such service\" as is done in SRV, MX is worth it?\r\n> \r\n>  I haven't heard anyone ask for this, so I don't consider it a priority.

Could we say that the semantics are the same as getting multiple Alt-Svc response headers?\r\n\r\nRFC 2616 says \"Multiple message-header fields with the same field-name MAY be present in a message if and only if the entire field-value for that header field is defined as a comma-separated list [i.e., #(values)].  It MUST be possible to combine the multiple header fields into one \"field-name: field-value\" pair, without changing the semantics of the message, by appending each subsequent field-value to the first, each separated by a comma.\"\r\n\r\nAlt-Svc says \"When multiple values are present, the order of the values reflects the server's preference\".\r\n\r\nI think this is actually workable.  The server can produce multiple RRs, each of which can contain multiple options in preference order.  The DNS client will scramble them, and then HTTP will glue them together in that order.

This attacker could inject a fraudulent DNS record that would then permit them to track that user even after they leave the network.  The adversary in this case is not the server operator.\r\n\r\nFor example, suppose there is a server operator who doesn't use Alt-Svc at all, and who serves the same domain on all IPs of a /64.  An adversary who can inject a long-TTL DNS record can pin a user to one of those IPs, and then reidentify that user across the internet whenever they visit that domain.  This can (and should) be solved by clearing the client's DNS cache when moving between networks.  Since DNS data in this case can be cached in the Alt-Svc cache, we need \"persist=0\" to get equivalent behavior.\r\n\r\nEDIT: Persist=1 would also enable a persistent DoS by a network that wants to block access to some site.",

I don't think we need to accommodate servers who've implemented the still-rare standard from 2018 but not the near-universal one from 2003.  AFAIK, no such servers exist today, and once HTTPSSVC is widely deployed, anybody who tried to set up such a server would quickly figure out that it is seriously broken\r\n\r\nAdditionally, this accommodation is not the only reason to apply this logic.  If you don't have a secure connection to your recursive, then respecting SERVFAIL doesn't actually protect you from a network adversary (specifically an adversary between you and the recursive).  With a validating resolver and a secure connection, respecting SERVFAIL provides reliable protection (on signed domains).\r\n\r\n> Perhaps a better approach is to synthesize an HSTS record just like we synthesize an Alt-Svc record and persist that independently of clearing the Alt-Svc records.\r\n\r\nThis approach is still opportunistic, not reliable against an active attacker.  It would also enable a persistent DoS by a transient local network adversary (as with persist=1).  I think this functionality is better served by the existing `Strict-Transport-Security` header, which can be set securely by the site itself on first access.",

The main point here is to find a way to make the average net performance loss negligible (or even a net win), even on legacy recursives (which will surely be prevalent for many years).

Must provide security features reliably or not at all.\r\n\r\nI'm certainly open to alternative solutions if you don't think this one will be convincing.

I've been hearing concerns from browser people that support for QUIC-only endpoints may be difficult to implement, because it complicates TCP fallback when UDP is failing.  I'm hoping that we can find a middle ground that addresses both needs.  (Feel free to switch to email if it's too long for this comment thread.)",

In the TLS use-case, specifying `tls` is sufficient because TLS has an in-band version negotiation mechanism that does not cost round-trips, and ALPN also doesn't cost round trips. For QUIC, it's not quite certain we'll have that, so it might help to indicate the QUIC version?

The concern that prompted this set of designs was that someone might publish a record indicating H3 support and providing ESNI keys, and thereby restrict those keys to the H3 endpoint.  It then makes it possible to disable ESNI over TLS/TCP by blocking the QUIC connection.\r\n\r\nBy requiring the record to explicitly disclaim H1/H2 support if it intends not to offer them on a given record, this accidental misconfiguration and associated attack become harder.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, I think that a list of transports is likely to have more staying power than particular versions.

Clients, in particular, parse untrusted input, so needless complexity in formats must be dropped.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the day, if it is possible to express an ESNI key for the QUIC path without an ESNI key for the TCP path, the client needs to do *something* in response to it. The draft currently says the interpretation is that you disable the TCP path, which is unacceptable (see https://github.com/MikeBishop/dns-alt-svc/issues/73#issuecomment-565681979). The alternative non-rejecting interpretation is to silently lose ESNI, which is also unacceptable.\r\n\r\nThus it *must* be considered a misconfiguration. Well-designed mechanisms make misconfigurations impossible to spell. Example: advertising QUIC is purely additive, without a `no-transport` option, like the original `Alternate-Protocol` header. `Alt-Svc`-like designs regress this.\r\n\r\nAlas, the reason for this regression was to support using different IPs for QUIC. We could do a two-level thing, with ESNI being specified at the top level, but this is perhaps a little goofy:\r\n```\r\ntcp.example.com; ipv4hint=1.2.3.4; port=443; esniconfigs=...; alt-transports={\r\n  quic={quic.example.com; ipv4hint=5.6.7.8; port=444},\r\n  fancyprotocol={fancyprotocol.example.com; ipv4hint=9.10.11.12; port=445},\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nFailing that, we are left with a misconfiguration that is otherwise syntactically valid. This is unstable under ecosystem effects and, as noted, receivers still must do *something*. To counter this, the spec *must* define requirements to reject as loudly as feasible so administrators fix it. Here is a concrete possibility:\r\n* There is a single \"default\" transport: whatever you would have done with A/AAAA records. It is specified by omitting the `transport` parameter and doesn't need a name.\r\n* Remove the odd filtering and empty string rules around `esniconfig`. Optionally filtering an HTTPSSVC set complicates the rule below. If you want ESNI, you need to specify it on each HTTPSSVC arm. (A network attacker can always redirect you to the other machines, so having ESNI-capable and ESNI-incapable IPs that both speak for the public name is an inherently insecure configuration.)\r\n* In a set of HTTPSSVC records, there must be one entry for the default transport. If there isn't, this is a misconfiguration:\r\n  * Authoritative DNS servers reject this at config-time and do not advertise it at all.\r\n  * Config file formats SHOULD make it hard to express the misconfiguration. Maybe add a `no-default-transport` token and compile it out? This is a local decision, so pick something.\r\n  * If the authoritative DNS server is non-compliant, clients silently drop the record and fall back to A/AAAA. (Failing the HTTP request would be ideal but probably too much due to DNS caching.)",

The goal isn't to make H3-only impossible to say, it's to make it difficult to say accidentally.\r\n\r\nStill, I think it's probably a fair assertion that HTTP services are practically guaranteed to include a TCP endpoint for the foreseeable future, and making that sound alarm bells if violated is a goal we can all agree on.

A bunch of comments and questions:\r\n\r\n    Can we name this something easier to write?\r\n    The usability of \"additional-transport\" seems poor.\r\n    Also, it is bikeshedding, but having a good name that\r\n    these tokens and their registry can be referred\r\n    to with and distinguished from ALPN seems critical.\r\n    (So far \"TP\" is the best I've come up with as writing\r\n    tp=tls is more readable.)\r\n\r\n    I'm not sure all encodings / data types have\r\n    an empty value as meaningful.\r\n\r\n    We should talk about the relationship of {additional-transport /\r\n    transport protocol} to ALPN. If we are going to go this path, this\r\n    seems like a broader conversation to have that we should loop people\r\n    like Martin Thompson and Tommy Pauly into as well. (There may be a\r\n    question as to whether there is value to also supporting ALPN, but\r\n    that may be unneeded complexity.) How this relates to Alt-Svc is\r\n    something that should likely have discussion in the HTTP and QUIC\r\n    (and perhaps TAPS?) working groups as well once there is a concrete\r\n    proposal. A question may be whether this should get factored into\r\n    its own document as this is a significant enough change to Alt-Svc.\r\n\r\n    One way to frame the difference may be that:\r\n        $TP (whatever we call it) defines a transport layer\r\n        or transport+security layer protocol (eg, TCP+TLS, UDP+QUIC).\r\n        Each of these provide a way to communicate over the network\r\n        in a way that a secure connection can be negotiated and\r\n        initiated.\r\n        ALPN is an aggreement as part of the $TP negotiation\r\n        to agree on the upper application-layer protocol\r\n        (eg, HTTP-over-HTTP/1.1 vs HTTP-over-HTTP/2).\r\n\r\n    Closely related to this is the relation of the \"transport protocol\r\n    set\" with ALPN values. (ie, are there cases where the client\r\n    needs to be aware which ALPN protocols within the transport\r\n    protocol an endpoint supports prior to connecting?)\r\n\r\n    Does it make sense that the transport registry is HTTPS-specific\r\n    or should a single registry be shared across HTTPS\r\n    and other protocols? I'd be inclined towards a single registry,\r\n    especially given the uniqueness properites with ALPN.\r\n    Having a bunch of registries all sharing a key space\r\n    sounds like a disaster.\r\n\r\n    There are legitimate use-cases for no-default-transport\r\n    outside ot web browsers. It would be entirely reasonable\r\n    for web services in a closed ecosystem to only support HTTP/3.\r\n\r\n    Do we need to update something to indicate that\r\n    the ALPN registry also doesn't collide with this?\r\n    Does IANA have a precedent for this? Would merging\r\n    these into a single registry with a new column (for if\r\n    it is a $TP or an ALPN) be easier?\r\n\r\n    We may want to be clear in our initial registry entries\r\n    that these are \"TLS over TCP\" and \"QUIC over UDP\" ?\r\n\r\n    We should provide guidance for how servers make\r\n    a transition for Alt-Svc from alpn to these additional-transports.\r\n    (ie, recommend that they include both, and we should probably\r\n    show this in our example.)\r\n\r\n    For \"tls\", what ALPN protocols does a server need to support?\r\n    Could a server be HTTP/2 only or HTTP/1.1 only? I guess\r\n    this will get figured out during the TLS handshake negotiation?\r\n    (How this relates to Alt-Svc is also important.)\r\n",

Those cases can just define a new parameter, I suppose.\r\n \r\nAs to whether it makes sense to require a particular ALPN value, I\u2019d argue that it doesn\u2019t.  ALPN is capable of restricting itself on either side \u2013 the client won\u2019t offer anything it\u2019s not willing to use, and the server won\u2019t choose anything it\u2019s not happy with.  The only value in knowing the \u201cexpected\u201d outcome in advance is to then fail the connection if you don\u2019t like what the server selected, even though you offered it as a valid choice.  (Or, potentially, for use with 0-RTT; but then you know in advance from the previous session without need of a SVCB record.)\r\n",

For UDP/QUIC/H3, the port is a UDP port. That maps TCP and UDP ports onto each other, which seems a little odd? But at least it's distinguishable because the endpoint layer branches.\r\n\r\nSuppose we were to later define UDP/VeryFancyProto/H4. This design more-or-less forces all new UDP-based protocols for transporting HTTP to share protocol invariants with QUIC. You get exactly two sets of protocol invariants, one for TCP and one for UDP, and then it starts getting very inconvenient. This is... odd.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if we were to define UDP/QUICv2/H3 such that QUIC and QUICv2 *did* expect to run together *but* benefited from an out-of-band version hint (if QUICv2 is purely in-band negotiation like TLS, then there is no need to incorporate it into HTTPSSVC at all), then this works as separate transports. Although it is interesting to note that, in that picture, UDP/QUIC and UDP/QUICv2 have a very different relationship from TCP/TLS. (I don't know how `Alternate-Protocol` expressed this, but Google's `Alt-Svc` advertisement for gQUIC seems to use a separate `v` attribute for denoting versions.)\r\n\r\nAn alternate design would have been to instead:\r\n1. Get rid of `no-default-transport`.\r\n2. `transport` is an optional single-valued token. If omitted, it is the default transport.\r\n3. `port` and other attributes modify just the one transport.\r\n4. Replace the \"if all of the RRs indicate `no-default-transport`\" with \"if none of the RRs indicates the default transport\".\r\n\r\nThis avoids the port oddities and flattens the structure a bit, which seems simpler to me. One wriggle is it requires duplicating the ESNI config per transport whereas this design avoids it *in cases where the port confusion is what you wanted*. (Clllleeeeaaarrly we need a more complicated encoding! :-D)\r\n\r\nAnother design would be some odd two-level thing where transports have associated attributes.\r\n\r\n@DavidSchinazi I'm curious what your thoughts on all this is.

There may indeed be two UDP transports that can't share a port.  That's fine; they can just go in separate RRs with different port numbers.\r\n\r\nWe could certainly restructure this to require one transport per RR, or to express multiple ports per RR (TCP and UDP or per-transport), but the former seems inefficient, and the latter seems overcomplicated.  Sharing a port number between TCP and UDP may not be precisely principled, but in practice IANA [almost always](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_TCP_and_UDP_port_numbers) assigns both ports to the same service, so I think it's fairly intuitive.\r\n\r\nAs you noted, sharing an RR is mostly a space optimization, especially with ESNIConfig.  My guess is that the majority of IPs that have QUIC and TLS with the same ESNIConfig will also have them at the same port number, so one-port-number-per-RR gets us most of the space savings with the least complexity.",

(Which we presumably care about or we'd go with the flattened design.)\r\n\r\nAgreed, although this syntax was also motivated by simplicity for zone owners when QUIC and TLS share all parameters, which we took to be the common case.\r\n\r\n> That means there will be pressure at the protocol design phase to share invariants, which means we effectively are saying this.\r\n\r\nI think this is at most a weak incentive, not a significant pressure on future designs.  Suppose NOTQUIC is a secure transport protocol over UDP that cannot share a port with QUIC.  (I think this is an unlikely scenario but we should nonetheless support it.)  In the current design, this would be written as\r\n```\r\n... port=1234 transport=quic esniconfig=\"abc...\" ; TLS and QUIC\r\n... port=4321 transport=notquic no-default-transport esniconfig=\"def...\" ; NOTQUIC\r\n```\r\nIn a flattened design, this would instead be\r\n```\r\n... port=1234 esniconfig=\"abc...\" ; TLS\r\n... port=1234 transport=quic esniconfig=\"abc...\" ; QUIC\r\n... port=4321 transport=notquic esniconfig=\"def...\" ; NOTQUIC\r\n```\r\nI don't see a major advantage in comprehensibility between these options.  On balance, I prefer the former; duplicating the ESNIConfig seems to invite typos and misconfigurations that will not easily be caught.\r\n\r\nBTW, even if NOTQUIC can't share a UDP port with QUIC, users can still avoid `no-default-transport` by running TLS on the TCP port of the same number.  This seems like a reasonable, perhaps likely configuration, for the same reasons that it appears to be popular with QUIC.",

It simultaneously believes `no-default-transport` is a rare misfeature only to be used for questionable deployment patterns, at the same time it is a pattern for new protocols. It then simultaneously believes duplicating the ESNIConfig is a problem and should be avoided, yet recommends it as a pattern for new protocols. All this mixup then pressures new protocols to share UDP ports to avoid all these design flaws, yet it also insists this pressure doesn't exist.\r\n\r\n> BTW, even if NOTQUIC can't share a UDP port with QUIC, users can still avoid no-default-transport by running TLS on the TCP port of the same number. This seems like a reasonable, perhaps likely configuration, for the same reasons that it appears to be popular with QUIC.\r\n\r\nNo, this is not a reasonable or likely configuration. Moreover, it's dangerous because it further incentivizes existing TCP HTTP servers to not check port numbers against the HTTP `Host` header. (This check is a security requirement for sites running different origins on different ports as it's the only thing preventing the network from mixing ports up.)\r\n\r\nIt's popular with QUIC because, barring any reason to pick another port, 443 is the natural one in order to match with the origin. HTTPSSVC having broken all these standard assumption is not going to suddenly make people want to deploy TCP over the corresponding port for NOTQUIC. That doesn't really make any sense at all.",

Possible with explicit action doesn't solve anything.

So I don't see any reason to ever treat it as anything other than malformed and thus reject the RRSet.  Better for completely invalid things to get noticed by brokenness, so people fix them.\r\n\r\nBut in general, anywhere that we have good reason to want future extensibility, yes, deterministic handling of things that are \"valid but unknown\" is often reasonable.

They can even dump malformed responses as hex blobs.\r\n\r\nNamed has been rejecting malformed RR content for over a decade now and I guarantee you that it has been a net plus.  I think there has been 1 bug report in that entire time where someone put garbage into a record in a zone and expected named to serve it rather than rejecting it or expected it to get through a resolver. \r\n\r\nI also think that you are worrying way too much about malformed records being there in the first place.  People will use tools to generate the records.  The tools will get it right from the start or will be very quickly fixed to get it right.  SERVFAIL from the recursive server is a great motivator to fix tools.\r\n\r\nAs for lazy clients, whether the resolver rejects malformed records or not it won't make a difference.\r\n\r\nI also don't want to have to do the validation of the record as I am printing it out.  Validation on data entry is much safer.\r\n\r\n",

I don't think it does any harm, but I suppose it's one less weird variation that could go unnoticed.\r\n\r\n> And since there's no requirement about the order of the pairs in the presentation format, duplicate pairs are allowed?\r\n\r\nNo, duplicate pairs are not allowed in the presentation format.  If the text is unclear on that point, please suggest a clarification.",

Therefore, it's entirely legitimate to populate it with public information, e.g. information anyone can obtain over DNS anyway.  It's also legitimate to populate it with junk or lie.  Those are implementation choices; we don't need to specify them.\r\n\r\nThe contents of the SVCB record are a server's declarations about its own capabilities; they are useful in the inner ClientHello and might be usable in the outer ClientHello if the implementation so chooses, since they're public anyway.  This particular parameter is about how to conceal the \"true\" ClientHello using ECHO.  The point of this paragraph is that you don't need this parameter to construct the inner ClientHello; you would construct the inner one as if this parameter weren't there, then encapsulate it if you have an EchoConfig.",

          "body": "Coincidentally, we were looking at WebSockets recently for cookies. It's a mess. :-( Whether this definition of \"HTTP-based\" works is... unclear. RFC 6455 does *not* map WebSockets to its corresponding http/https scheme. It believes WebSockets is an entirely independent protocol with an HTTP-looking handshake for convenience.\r\n\r\n>   The WebSocket Protocol is an independent TCP-based protocol.  Its\r\n>   only relationship to HTTP is that its handshake is interpreted by\r\n>   HTTP servers as an Upgrade request.\r\n\r\nBut this is an unhelpful way to specify it and was probably a mistake. It doesn't tell you how WebSockets interacts with cookies, HTTP auth, or redirects, and led to a mess of interop issues.\r\n\r\nFetch, accordingly, [overrides this](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#websocket-protocol) and [maps the schemes to HTTP](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#websocket-opening-handshake). This is partially a no-op because cookies don't check schemes, but we should [fix that](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-west-cookie-incrementalism-01). At that point we'll be in a weird situation where, without the WHATWG override of the IETF spec, WebSockets' interactions with cookies will be somewhere between incorrect and insufficiently specified. :-(\r\n\r\nHow that translates to what this specification should do, I don't know. It may make sense to just special-case WebSockets and declare the RFC 6455 specification strategy was a mistake and we shouldn't do it again. Then again, that still means new \"webby\" protocols that are less HTTP-adjacent (WebTransport?) will require separate SVCB records, which also seems poor. Every extra thing we stick in the query (scheme, port, etc.) weakens the security benefits (HTTPS upgrade, ECH).",

Maybe as well do a plain 302 redirect at that point.",

Isn't it still possible in a deployment to choose to separate out CNAMEs differently if you need only some to support ECH? That way, the burden of disabling uniform encryption is placed upon the server DNS deployment, not on the clients that now need to write codepaths to pass up ECH keys but also consider that the connection may not support TLS.\r\n\r\nIt feels like we should make things easy to be secure, but not optimize for cases that are insecure and should long-term be fixed.",

I'd call that much worse than forcing the last 1% to upgrade (or for them to switch to cdn2.example.net to keep working).\r\n\r\nOverall, I'm not a fan of disabling the upgrade, even with the newer \"compromise\" of only supporting it with ECH.  It's overall a good thing if HTTPSSVC and ECH force more HTTPS usage, and it seems a reasonable requirement in 2020.  The ECH-only part just adds an unnecessary (and kinda weird) complication that I'd really rather not support.",

I could see CDNs with \"free tiers\" just enabling ECH for shared domains, but the risk/reward and business drivers may not exist yet in the commercial space.\r\n\r\nIt may be a reasonable decision to decide not to do this from a complexity perspective, but with the understanding that we should not then expect default ECH enablement for existing sites in some of the environments that would most benefit.",

(The wrong thing being considered compliant by confused clients results in deployment implications for a server trying to use SVCB.) But, given the point is to disavow that and get these Alt-Svc-like mechanisms out of the business of messing with ALPN as much as possible, I'm good with something shorter and lighter on details.\r\n\r\nThough that suggestion might be a little *too* light? It's arguably not *quite* a hint because an `h3` SVCB record will (at least for now) result in different ALPN advertisement than an `h2` record due to different sets of ALPNs being \"compatible\". If we don't want to go down the rabbithole of defining that just yet, maybe something like:\r\n\r\n> Note a client may not be willing to negotiate all protocols over all connections, and would advertise ALPN protocols accordingly. For example, an HTTP client using an `h3` record for a QUIC connection would not advertise `http/1.1` or `h2`. However, when using an `h2` record for a TCP connection, it may advertise both `http/1.1` and `h2`, and accept either protocol from the server.\r\n\r\nWDYT?",

I guess my interpretation was that, if `ClientHelloFromSVCB(proto=h2)` and `ClientHelloFromSVCB(proto=http/1.1)` both result in the same ClientHello (based on the rule that you include all of them), that's fine whether I connect to them serially or in parallel or whatever.\r\n\r\nWhat does consolidating mean if, say, I see SVCB records for h2 and http/1.1 but other properties, like ECH keys or addresses, are different? I figured the model would be that you pick which one(s) you want, and send out ClientHellos for them. If you decided you wanted to race the http/1.1 and h2 records, they'll end up sending the same ALPN. If you decided you wanted to race an h3 one in there, it will be different. When picking them, you probably do need to be aware of the correspondence, but I think the impact is less security and more making your connection strategy coherent.",

The suggested approach is essentially to have an alternate character-string parser that (1) splits on unescaped commas, and (2) returns an array of strings rather than a string. I think an equally appealing approach is to first use a character-string parser that always returns a string and ignores backslash escapes other than \\\". All other uses (such as TXT records) would unescape the returned string; the alpn parser would first split the returned string on unescaped commas, then unescape each component string. I believe these two approaches are functionally identical but I find the latter a bit cleaner.",

Then the character-string decoding algorithm is applied to each `char-string`, yielding `example1`, `weird, why?`, and `example2`.  This is because double-quotes are optional in `char-string`.\r\n\r\nMy goal here is to make the parsing algorithm easy to implement, so please suggest changes.  I proposed this formulation to minimize the amount of new parsing code required (reuse the same decoding algorithm), while making sure that all `alpn-id`s are representable, including those that contain commas and spaces.
